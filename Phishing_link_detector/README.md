# 🔗 Phishing Link Detector

This project showcases the development of a **Phishing Link Detection Tool** designed to enhance online security by analyzing **URLs** and detecting **potentially harmful phishing links** based on their structure, patterns, and characteristics.

## 🛡️ Why This Matters

Phishing attacks are a common threat, tricking users into visiting **malicious websites** that steal personal data. This tool helps combat that risk by:

✅ Analyzing URL structures  
✅ Detecting suspicious patterns commonly found in phishing links  
✅ Providing a **quick assessment** of link safety

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **Scikit-learn** | Pattern analysis and model training (optional if using ML) |
| **Regex** | URL pattern matching |


---

## 📊 How It Works

1. The user inputs a **URL**.
2. The tool evaluates the URL using:
   - URL length and composition
   - Presence of suspicious keywords
   - Unusual domain or subdomain patterns
   - Special character analysis
3. Based on the analysis, the tool flags the link as:
   - ✅ Safe
